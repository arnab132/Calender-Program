# Calender-Program

Problem: To print the calendar of any given year. The program should be such that it can prints the calendar of any input year.

Here, we are given a year and we want to print the calendar for that year.

The year calendar shows all days, months on every date of the month. And here we will create a program that will return the calendar of the current year.

For this, we will need some calculations like,

Number of days in a specific month
January, March, May, July, August, October, December has 31 days.

February has 28 days in a nonleap year and 29 days in a leap year.

April, June, September, November has 30 days.

Start Day (weekday) on the month
Based on the year and month, the weekday is found for the 1st of every month.
